<summary>About me:</summary>
<br>
  
Hello! My name is Christian N Warjri. I am currently in university working towards my Computer Science degree. I realised early on that I really liked being on my computer 😅. I was either gaming or browsing the internet or just general shenanigans using my PC. Today, I am fascinated by data science - machine learning, deep learning, general analytics, and fun interactive visualisations to tell stories with data and glean insights that hide under our naked eye.
