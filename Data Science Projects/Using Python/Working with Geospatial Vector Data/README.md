## Project: Geospatial Vector Data Workbook

The purpose of this short project is to document my workings with geospatial data manipulation.

### 💪 Motivation: 

The initial motivation of this workbook is to become familiar with the inner workings of integrating spatial data into my workflow. The wish was to interact, manipulate and augment publically available geospatial data.

### 📊 Dataset:

Various datasets regarding the city of Paris from trees, restaurants types, and districts in the city.

### ⚒️ Tools and Skills Used:
File formats (how to read and interact with) such as **GeoJSON, ESRI shapefiles, geopackages** for vector data as well as **GeoTIFF** for raster data.

Packages and libraries such as **geopandas, GDAL, contextily, rasterio, shapely** for geometries.

**Matplotlib, different types of choropleths adjusting the clustering algorithm, color scheme etc.** for visualisations.

Better understanding of **EPSG formats** and the industry standard **EPSG4326/WSG84** and the conversions to other **CRSs**.

Geospatial relationships such as **union, intersection, and overlays along with buffer and unary operations** etc.

### 🗺️ Maps:
