## Project: Geospatial Vector Data Workbook

The purpose of this short project is to document my workings with geospatial data manipulation.

### Motivation: 

The initial motivation of this workbook is to become familiar with the inner workings of integrating spatial data into my workflow. The wish was to interact, manipulate and augment publically available geospatial data.

### Dataset:

Various datasets regarding the city of Paris from trees, restaurants types, and districts in the city.

### Tools and Skills Used:
New file formats (how to read and interact with) such as **GeoJSON, ESRI shapefiles, geopackages** for vector data as well as **GeoTIFF** for raster data.
New packages and libraries such as **geopandas, GDAL, contextily, rasterio, shapely for geometries**.
New ways to visualise
