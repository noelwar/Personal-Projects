## Project: Cardio Fitness Business Analytics

The purpose of this short project is to highlight my skill in bringing values for businesses through various sorts of analyses. Making a user profile from the data, I managed to derive valuable insights from the [CardioGoodFitness](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/cardiogoodfitness) dataset.

### 💪 Motivation: 

The initial inspiration for this workbook was as a class project. However, as the technical proficiency of my team needed more growth, I delved into this project myself using my business acumen, data science toolkit and statistical know-how to clean, manipulate and visualise this dataset. 

### 📊 Dataset:

The dataset used here is the [CardioGoodFitness](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/cardiogoodfitness) dataset, which has a certain type of treadmill sold, and the user's age, sex, occupation, pay etc. of the user who bought that.

### ⚒️ Tools and Skills Used:
Answering different types of business questions from the different types of products that were sold, their rates and velocities and the user profile of each customer who purchased that specific product.

My business acumen was highlighted through my various charts and presentations made, which highlight my ability to derive key insights from a dataset to bring a tangible value to the stakeholders.
