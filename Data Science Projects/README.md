# Data Science Projects

Hello! 👋🏼

This page serves as an introduction to my Data Science Projects page. 📊

My projects are divided into 2 parts:

[Projects in R 🤖](https://github.com/noelwar/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Using%20R)

[Projects in Python 🐍](https://github.com/noelwar/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Using%20Python)

Click on either and the specific document to know more and to get a glimpse of each!

I hope you enjoy going through it! 🤩
