# Data Visualisations

> “No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” - Daniel Kahneman 

My philosophy towards making data visualisations is to always remember that each data point is a page of a larger story. Data visualisations are ultimately about story telling 📖. Good storytelling elements like thematic consistency, well thought-out rhythm and pacing, and concise dialogue applies to visualisations as well. With that, I hope you enjoy my visualisations! 

## Background

In this section I will go through the vizzes that I have made, which have either been for my own personal curiousity and skill-development 📊 or for my professional work as a data scientist/analyst in my previous roles 👔. I mostly use Tableau however I have a working proficiency in R's Shiny, Power BI and Streamlit to different extents. 

## Examples

Below is a few highlights of my vizzes!

### [Frequency of American Birthdays (1994 - 2014)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noelwar/viz/AmericanBirthdaysPast20Years/D1?publish=yes)

- About: Here, the intensity of the purplish hues on each tile in the heatmap represent the average number of births per month and day from 1994 - 2014. Similarly, the intensity of the bluish hues represent the average number of hypothetical moments of conception for the same time period.

- Motivation: Personal Tableau Projects

- Objective: Highlight the highest average number of births and hypothetical moments of conceptions in the U.S. for 1994- 2014.

### [Percentage of Partially Vaccinated Localities](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noelwar/viz/Vacc1/D1)

- About: Here, the vaccination rates of each area (dot) belonging to their respective localities (colour of dot) are shown. The dots above 100% vaccination represented how some people from outside the district went to that district to get vaccinated.

- Motivation: Data Analyst (COVID Taskforce) @ Government of Meghalaya

- Objective: Convey to the public the poor vaccination status of most of the areas of the district.

- Note: The dashboard is interactive and updated in realtime as the district gets more data (this was until 2021).

### [Fully Vaccinated vs Partially Vaccinated vs Not-Vaccinated Deaths](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noelwar/viz/Deaths5/Dashboard#4)

- About: Here, each death (bubble) is displayed in a bubble chart grouped by their vaccination status (colour). When you hover over the bubbles, you will see the age, sex, comorbidity status and date the person died.

- Motivation: Data Analyst (COVID Taskforce) @ Government of Meghalaya

- Objective: Convey to the public how most of the deaths were because people were not vaccinated.

- Note: The dashboard is interactive and updated in realtime as the district gets more data (this was until 2021).
