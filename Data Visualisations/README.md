# Data Visualisations

> “No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” - Daniel Kahneman 

My philosophy towards making data visualisations is to always remember that each data point is a page of a larger story. Data visualisations are ultimately about story telling 📖. Good storytelling elements like thematic consistency, well thought-out rhythm and pacing, and concise dialogue applies to visualisations as well. With that, I hope you enjoy my visualisations! 

## Background

In this section I will go through the vizzes that I have made, which have either been for my own personal curiousity and skill-development 📊 or for my professional work as a data scientist/analyst in my previous roles 👔. I mostly use Tableau however I have a working proficiency in R's Shiny, Power BI and Streamlit to different extents. 

## Examples

Below is a few highlights of my vizzes!
