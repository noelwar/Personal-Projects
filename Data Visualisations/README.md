# Data Visualisations

> “No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” - Daniel Kahneman 

My philosophy towards making data visualisations is to always remember that each data point is a page of a larger story. Data visualisations are ultimately about story telling 📖. Good storytelling elements like thematic consistency, well thought-out rhythm and pacing, and concise dialogue applies to visualisations as well. With that, I hope you enjoy my visualisations! 

## Background

In this section I will go through the vizzes that I have made, which have either been for my own personal curiousity and skill-development 📊 or for my professional work as a data scientist/analyst in my previous roles 👔. I mostly use Tableau however I have a working proficiency in R's Shiny, Power BI and Streamlit to different extents. 

## Examples

Below is a few highlights of my vizzes!

### [Percentage of Partially Vaccinated Localities](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noelwar/viz/Vacc1/D1)

This viz was made when I was a data analyst for the Government of Meghalaya. Here, the vaccination rates of each area (dot) belonging to their respective localities (colour of dot) are shown. The essence of this viz was to convey to the public the poor vaccination status of most of the areas of the district. 

Note: The dots above 100% vaccination represented how some people from outside the district went to that district to get vaccinated.
